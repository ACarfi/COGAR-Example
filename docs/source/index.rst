COGAR example's documentation
=========================================

This documentation serves as an example for the Cognitive Architecture for Robotics course at UniGe in 2025 by Alessandro Carf√¨. It focuses on how to properly document a ROS package using Sphinx and Read the Docs.

The `package <https://github.com/ACarfi/COGAR-Example>`_ includes:

- A talker node that publishes messages.
- A listener node that subscribes and processes messages.
- A launch file to run both nodes together.

While the package is a simple ROS example, the primary goal is to demonstrate best practices for writing clear, structured, and maintainable documentation.
